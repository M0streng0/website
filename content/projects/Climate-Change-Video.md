## Video
This endeavor constituted a scholastic assignment pertaining to the discourse on Climate Change.

In the creation of these visual narratives, I employed tools of the likes of Adobe After-Effects and Adobe Premiere Pro.

This collaborative effort transpired as a group project, duly acknowledged within the attributions of the accompanying video.

## Poster
A poster was likewise conceived for the aforementioned project, seamlessly aligned with the thematic focus on Climate Change that underscored the collective endeavor.

The fabrication of this visual representation was executed through the utilization of Adobe Photoshop.
