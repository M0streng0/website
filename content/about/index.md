## I'm Henrique Oliveira

{{< about image="/images/about/about.webp" alt="Image of me, reading a book (Altered Carbon, by Richard K. Morgan), while listening to music through my Sony headphones." >}}
A _student_, _programmer_, and _hacker_.

Yet, above all, I'm just a curious _human_ embracing the digital realm.

From delving into Cyberpunk realms in science fiction to exploring diverse musical genres, my interests extend beyond code. Advocating for a free and democratic internet, I contribute to the open-source movement, blending my love for technology with a passion for the arts, expressed through photography.

In this digital haven, I thrive on the thrill of the new and unexplored. Whether crafting code, testing the limits of cybersecurity, or embracing challenges across various tech domains, my journey is a fusion of creativity and innovation. Join me as I capture the essence of this dynamic intersection, where each exploration reveals the boundless potential of the digital realm.

**Welcome to my digital space where the human and the virtual converge.**.
